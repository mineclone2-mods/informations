# What is the Goal of the project?

This project aims to port opensource minecraft mods (forge or fabric) to [MineClone2](https://git.minetest.land/MineClone2/MineClone2)

All these ported mods have:
- GPLv3 licence (same as MineCLone2)
- luacheck code checking with GitHub actions
- support ONLY mcl2
- have the same contributing guidelines as MineClone2
